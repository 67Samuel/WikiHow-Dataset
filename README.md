# WikiHow-Dataset
A Large Scale Text Summarization Dataset

WikiHow is a new large-scale dataset using the online WikiHow (http://www.wikihow.com/) knowledge base. Each article consists of multiple paragraphs and each paragraph starts with a sentence summarizing it. By merging the paragraphs to form the article and the paragraph outlines to form the summary, the resulting version of the dataset contains more than 200,000 long-sequence pairs.

The data file is one .csv file consisting of three main parts:

|Title|kkc bg|
|Headline|lrjg|
|Text|kdfnj|
